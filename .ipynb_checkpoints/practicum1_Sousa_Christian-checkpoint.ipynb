Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n\n**Here are the rules:** \n\n1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n\nViolation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on this practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n\n**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n\n***\n\n**Name**:  \n\n***\n\n\n**NOTES**: \n\n- You may not use late days on the practicums nor can you drop your practicum grades. \n- If you have a question for us, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If we decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class, then we will add it to a Practicum clarifications thread. \n- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n\n---\n"

   "source": "You're a time traveling data scientist, and have traveled way back to the year 1654. Immediately upon arriving you're picked up by a bunch of pirates, and made to join a pirate crew. When the pirates realize that you're immensely knowledgable about probabilities and statistics, they promote you to be their captain! You rename the ship to be the \"Certain Probability of Death\", and set out upon the high seas. After a few days of sailing you come upon another band of buccaneers in their ship. Their captain, Peg Leg Pascal Fermat, challanges you to a gambling game, but you're not sure if you should play it. The rules for the game are below:\n\n* You and Peg Leg Pascal Fermat will take turns repeatedly rolling a 20 sided die. The die has values 1 - 20 on it.\n\n\n* **On your turn, the rules are as follows:**\n1. If you roll the same value as what Peg Leg Pascal Fermat rolled on his last turn, you have to give him 5 dubloons. Do not perform any additional actions from the below list of rules if you rolled the same value as what Peg Leg Pascal Fermat rolled on his last turn. Otherwise:\n2. If you roll an 8, Peg Leg Pascal Fermat will give you two gold dubloons.\n3. If you roll a 7, Peg Leg Pascal Fermat will give you four gold dubloon.\n4. If you roll a 15, you have to give Peg Leg Pascal Fermat one dubloon. \n5. If you roll a 1, the game ends.\n6. If you roll any other value, nothing happens. \n\n\n* **On Peg Leg Pascal Fermat's turn the rules are as follows:**\n1. If Peg Leg Pascal Fermat rolls the same number as you did on your last turn, he then rolls a different 19 sided die. When he rolls again, if he rolls a 19, **you must pay him** 100 dubloons. If he rolls anything other than a 19, **he must pay you** the same number of dubloons as the value of the roll. E.g. If he rolls a 10, he gives you 10 dubloons, but if he rolls a 19 you give him 100 dubloons. When he rolls again, he does not perform any other rules from the below list.\n2. If Peg Leg Pascal Fermat rolls a 2, he must give you one gold dubloon.\n3. If Peg Leg Pascal Fermat rolls a 14, you must give him two dubloons.\n4. If Peg leg Pascal Fermat rolls a 17, you must give him three dubloons.\n5. If Peg Leg Pascal Fermat rolls a 1, the game ends.\n\n6. If Peg Leg Pascal Fermat rolls a 3, he takes off his peg leg, and gives you the leg. Who knows... Maybe it will be usefull if you lose your leg? \n7. If Peg Leg Pascal Fermat rolls a 3 and he has already given you his peg leg, he must give you 3 dubloons. \n8. If he rolls any other values, nothing happens.\n<img

Each row contains the results of a game that another player played against Peg Leg Pascal Fermat. It's a little bit dirty (after all this .csv was buried in the sand). Perform the following cleaning tasks:\n1. Read in the .csv. If you have any trouble reading in the file, open it in a text editor and take a look at it. You might find the pandas documentation for the `read_csv` function and some of the optional arguments useful. \n2. Look at the two columns. One of them is useless. Drop the useless one.\n3. Drop any strings of non-integer data.\n3. Check to see if any of our values are floating point values. If there are any, drop them. \n5. Drop any values that are over 1000 or under -1000. \n6.

Change the axes label font to be 14pt, the x-tick and y-tick font to be 8pt, the title font to be 16pt, and the legend font to be 12pt. Isn't that nicer? "

   "source": "In the file `flipadelphia.csv` you will find the results of an experiment that was conducted by Amy, the famous hedgehog data scientist, as she was flipping a coin one sunny day in a meadow. This is no ordinary coin, however: this coin has on one side Sonic, and on the other side Tails! The two sides of this coin are above, and at [this link](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~tonyewong/home/resources/hedgehog_coin.jpg).\n\nIn Amy's experiment she repeatedly flipped the coin until it came up Sonic. After each trial, she recorded her observed value for $X=$ the number of flips required to see the first Sonic. The results are stored in `flipadelphia.csv`.\n\nAmy has a lot of coins for performing cool data science experiments, and these coins have different biases (not all unique). Amy is a forgetful hedgehog, so she isn't sure which coin she was flipping. Her coins have biases of $p_S=.2, .3, .4, .5, .6, .7$ and $.8$, where $p_S$ is the probability of any given flip coming up Sonic."

What appears to be the most probable value for the bias, $p_S$? This is called the _maximum a posteriori_ estimate, because it maximizes the posterior distribution and sounds very, *very* fancy."
